firstly, go and install the latest python (current is 3.10) from python.org
then before you install it, make sure you check 'Add to PATH' checkbox (or you wont be able to use pip for the necessities)
then open cmd (no need of administrator)and type these (cancopy paste it too

pip install pyqt5
pip install PyQtWebEngine

make sure you install these seperately (unless you know what you are doing)

now run py onix-browser.py (or you can use launch with python directly)
to launch the browser in cmd and BOOMSHAKALAKA! you have epic onix browser
