# about
onix browser is simple browser, not a lot of stuff
made on full python
not laggy at all, go enjoy

only thing in this browser is a damn search bar and navigation bar LOL


# how to install
firstly, go and install the latest python (current is 3.10) from python.org
then before you install it, make sure you check 'Add to PATH' checkbox (or you wont be able to use pip for the necessities)
then open cmd (no need of administrator)and type these (can copy paste it too)

'pip install pyqt5'
'pip install PyQtWebEngine'

make sure you install these seperately (unless you know what you are doing)

now run py onix-browser.py (or you can use launch with python directly)
to launch the browser in cmd and BOOMSHAKALAKA! you have epic onix browser
